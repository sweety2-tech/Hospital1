In this project, I am leveraging powerful data analytics tools—Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI—to analyze and visualize hospital-related data. The objective is to extract meaningful insights that can support decision-making in healthcare environments. This project aims to explore patient demographics, treatment patterns, admission and discharge trends, and overall hospital performance. By transforming raw hospital data into actionable intelligence, this analysis highlights the critical role data plays in improving patient care, operational efficiency, and strategic planning in the healthcare sector.
